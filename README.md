# RasPi_Station
** Raspberry Pi Weather Station **

This is (yet another) version of a weather station based on a Raspberry Pi.
It provides data for temperature, humidity and air pressure which are available via a nice web interface.
The sensors aren't directly attached to the Pi, but instead the data is collected by an Arduino and is sent over Bluetooth.
In addition it also tries to calculate a forecast based on the pressure history.
